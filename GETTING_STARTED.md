- ✅ Fast development server (Vite)
- ✅ All your modules (PM, Inventory, HR, etc.)
- ✅ Simple, clean code structure

## 🚀 Your App is Running!

**Open in browser:** http://localhost:3000

## 📍 Navigation

### Main Routes:
- **/** - Home page

## 🎊 What's Different from Before?

### Old Setup (Next.js)
- ❌ Hydration errors
- ❌ Complex dependency tree
- ❌ Slow build times
- ❌ Drag-and-drop didn't work

### New Setup (React + Vite)
- ✅ No hydration issues
- ✅ Simple dependencies
- ✅ Lightning-fast development
- ✅ Drag-and-drop works perfectly!

## 📦 Dependencies

- React 18
- React Router (for navigation)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Lucide React (for icons)
- TypeScript (for type safety)

## 🐛 Need Help?

If anything doesn't work:
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. Check browser console (F12)
3. Restart dev server: `Ctrl + C` then `npm run dev`

**Enjoy your new drag-and-drop Kanban board!** 🚀
